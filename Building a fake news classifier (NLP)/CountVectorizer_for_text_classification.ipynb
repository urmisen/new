        "In this exercise, you'll use pandas alongside scikit-learn to create a sparse text vectorizer you can use to train and test a simple supervised model. To begin, you'll set up a CountVectorizer and investigate some of its features.\n",

        "* Using df[\"text\"] (features) and y (labels), create training and test sets using train_test_split(). Use a test_size of 0.33 and a random_state of 53.\n",
        "* Create a CountVectorizer object called count_vectorizer. Ensure you specify the keyword argument stop_words=\"english\" so that stop words are removed.\n",
